/** A request that a [[io.github.cakelier.tuples.space.client.JsonTupleSpace]] can make to its server.
  *
  * This trait represents a generic request that a [[io.github.cakelier.tuples.space.client.JsonTupleSpace]] client can make, in
  * order to obtain a [[io.github.cakelier.tuples.space.response.Response]] from the server it has connected to. Requests can be
  * divided in two categories: proper requests and meta-requests. The first ones are used to carry data from the client to the
  * server and they always have a content, which can be a single [[JsonTuple]], a [[Seq]] of them etc. Meta-requests are instead
  * used for carrying metadata from the client to the server, for example for managing the [[UUID]] that the server has given to
  * the client.
